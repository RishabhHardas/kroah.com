    I agree that this is one of the main problems.

    But look at how to solve it. The _logical_ solution is 
    to have a third line of defense: we have the -mm trees
    (wild and wacky patches), and we have my tree (hopefully
    not wacky any more), and it would be good to have a
    third level tree (which I'm just not interested in, 
    because that one doesn't do any development any more)
    which only takes the "so totally not wild that it's
    really boring" patches.
