What happened to BitKeeper?


    Subject: Kernel SCM saga
    From: Linus Torvalds

    Ok, as a number of people are already aware (and in some
    cases have been aware over the last several weeks), we've
    been trying to work out a conflict over BK usage over the
    last month or two (and it feels like longer ;). That hasn't
    been working out, and as a result, the kernel team is looking
    at alternatives.
