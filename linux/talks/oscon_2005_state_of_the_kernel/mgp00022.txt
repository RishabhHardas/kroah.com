No one is that foolish

   <Linus continued>

   I'll tell you what the problem is: I don't think you'll
   find anybody to do the parallell "only trivial patches" tree.
   They'll go crazy in a couple of weeks. Why? Because it's a
   _damn_ hard problem. Where do you draw the line? What's
   an acceptable patch? And if you get it wrong, people will
   complain _very_ loudly, since by now you've "promised" them
   a kernel that is better than the mainline.
