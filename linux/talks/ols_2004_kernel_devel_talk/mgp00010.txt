How can we do this and stay sane?


All patches end up in the -mm tree

All bk trees end up in the -mm tree
17 different trees
acpi, agpgart, alsa, cpu_freq, dma, driver_core, drm, ieee1394, input, jfs, libata, mpc52xx, netdev, utfs, pnp, scsi, usb

Andrew sends the patches to Linus

Maintainers still get Linus to pull from bk trees
